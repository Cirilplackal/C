#Linear search in C

Linear search in C programming: The following code implements linear search (Searching algorithm) which is used to find whether a given number is present in an array and if it is present then at what location it occurs. It is also known as sequential search. It is straightforward and works as follows: We keep on comparing each element with the element to search until it is found or the list ends. Linear search in C language for multiple occurrences and using function..

#C program for bubble sort

C program for bubble sort: C programming code for bubble sort to sort numbers or arrange them in ascending order. You can modify it to print numbers in descending order.You can also sort strings using Bubble sort, it is less efficient as its average and worst case complexity is high, there are many other fast sorting algorithms like quick-sort, heap-sort, etc. Sorting simplifies problem-solving in computer programming.
 
#Insertion sort in C

Insertion sort in C: C program for insertion sort to sort numbers. This code implements insertion sort algorithm to arrange numbers of an array in ascending order. With a little modification, it will arrange numbers in descending order. Best case complexity of insertion sort is O(n), average and the worst case complexity is O(n2).
