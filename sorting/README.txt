#Linear search in C

Linear search in C programming: The following code implements linear search (Searching algorithm) which is used to find whether a given number is present in an array and if it is present then at what location it occurs. It is also known as sequential search. It is straightforward and works as follows: We keep on comparing each element with the element to search until it is found or the list ends. Linear search in C language for multiple occurrences and using function..

#C program for bubble sort

C program for bubble sort: C programming code for bubble sort to sort numbers or arrange them in ascending order. You can modify it to print numbers in descending order.You can also sort strings using Bubble sort, it is less efficient as its average and worst case complexity is high, there are many other fast sorting algorithms like quick-sort, heap-sort, etc. Sorting simplifies problem-solving in computer programming.

#C program for binary search

C program for binary search: This code implements binary search in C language. It can only be used for sorted arrays, but it's fast as compared to linear search. If you wish to use binary search on an array which isn't sorted, then you must sort it using some sorting technique say merge sort and then use the binary search algorithm to find the desired element in the list. If the element to be searched is found then its position is printed. The code below assumes that the input numbers are in ascending order.
