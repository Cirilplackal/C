Program Explanation

1. Ask the user for the operation like push, pop, display and exit. Use the variable top to represent the top of the stack.
2. According to the option entered, access its respective function using switch statement.
3. In the function push(), firstly check if the stack is full. If it is, then print the output as “Stack is Full”. Otherwise take the number to be inserted as input and store it in the variable num. Copy the number to the array stk[] and increment the variable top by 1.
4. In the function pop(), firstly check if the stack is empty. If it is, then print the output as “Stack is Empty”. Otherwise print the top most element of the array stk[] and decrement the variable top by 1.
5. In the function display(), using for loop print all the elements of the array.
6. Exit.

STACKARRAY;
   The C Program is written for implementation of STACK using Array, the basic operations of stack are PUSH(), POP() and DISPLAY(). PUSH function in the code is used to insert an element to the top of stack, POP function used to remove the element from the top of stack. Finally display function used to print the values at any time. All stack functions are implemented in C Code.
